## Introduction

This is a release of multilingual contrastive adapter set (involving three different granularities of natural language text) referenced in [GranCATs: Cross-Lingual Enhancement through Granularity-Specific Contrastive Adapters](https://pan.baidu.com/s/17K0OO6q2D56UuQC6-gXFyA?pwd=qkjw )

Our goal is to provide a effective and cheap method to enable MLLMs(Multilingual Language Models) handle well cross-lingual representaion alignments and boost the performance on downstream tasks, without an extensive parallel corpus and computational resources. 

You can download the parallel corpus covering 29 kinds of languages from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NGsvjAe2VOc3CyTHbgCCvA?pwd=rtx8). This corpus involve **phrase-level**, **sentence-level** and **paragraph-level** of text.
